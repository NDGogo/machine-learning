# Machine Learning

## Definitions

## Concepts
    - Datasets are split into training and est data to prevent overfit.
         = Models with huge validation data sets will cause the models to take longer to build. However the bigger the validation set than the test set, the harder it is to overfit.
    - All parameters used to interpret the test results must only be based on the training data.
